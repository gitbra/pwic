# Pwic.wiki server written with Python and SQLite


## Presentation

**Pwic.wiki** (pronounce /puik/) is a flexible and compact wiki server to support the documentation of your projects through comprehensive features and 5 basic roles. Its purpose is to serve as a common repository where the essential documentation can be easily located, accessed, edited, compared, validated, shared, exported and eventually analyzed by your own scripts.

*Pwic.wiki* is an advanced concept that attempts to fix the methodological limitations that you can face by participating to an IT project. If you ever wasted your time on managing your files, templates, styles and validations, you are probably searching for a fresh solution to support your process!

The [official homepage](https://pwic.wiki) is running the latest version.

## Install

### Mandatory technical setup

- Install Python >=3.7: `apt-get install python3 python3-pip gzip --no-install-recommends`
- Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/gitbra/pwic.git` or uncompress the [latest modifications](https://github.com/gitbra/pwic/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) in the folder of your choice
- Install the dependencies: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
	- If your packages are managed by the system, use instead `apt-get install python3-xxx` where `xxx` stands for the name of each package listed in the file `requirements.txt`
- Optionally modify some default values in the file `pwic_lib.py` with a text editor to increase the security:
	- Change the default password in `PwicConst.DEFAULTS['password']`
	- Write random characters in the secret salt `PwicConst.SALT` forever
- Initialize the database: `python3 pwic_admin.py init-db`
	- A sub-folder `db/` is created for all your data

### Quick local setup

- Create a new project `demo` for the user `admin`: `python3 pwic_admin.py create-project demo "Demo project" admin`
- Run the server: `python3 pwic.py`
- Open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default
- Log in with your account and change your password by using the link in the footer
- In the special area of the project, grant yourself the role *Manager* to allow the creation of new pages

Once you have well tested Pwic.wiki and defined the global and project-dependent variables described in the embedded help file, you can use the bind address `0.0.0.0` and change the port in the main command line.
