    The behavior of Pwic is changeable in this file through a logic of events
    positioned at critical positions in the code base. It is easier to implement
    some changes here but it remains sensible from a technical perspective.

    Each method is always active and generally returns from 0 to 2 results.
    The first one usually tells if something happened. The second one provides
    the new result. With no result, the parameters of the method are changeable
    if they are passed as a reference, else raise an exception.
