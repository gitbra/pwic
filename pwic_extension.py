class PwicExtension():
    ''' Extensions for Pwic.wiki

        The behavior of Pwic.wiki is changeable in this file through a logic of events
        positioned at critical positions in the code base. It is easier and safer to
        implement some changes here but it remains technically sensitive.

        Each method is always active and generally returns from 0 to 2 results.
        The first one usually indicates if something happened. The second one provides
        the new result. With no result, the parameters of the method are changeable
        if they are passed as a reference, else raise an exception.
